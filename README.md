One day i bought a journal than contained one sudoku task
Of course i made it by myself, but i decided to write a program that can do it for me

And here it is, my version of sudoku auto solver

---

It creates file *pole.txt* where you put your problem and then you can get your answer in the console.

Maybe in future i make ui, but there is no garantee =)
