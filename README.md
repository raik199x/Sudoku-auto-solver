Here is my version of sudoku auto-solver

One day i bought a journal than contained one sudoku task
Of course i made it by myself, but i decided to write a program that can do it for me

And here it is, my version of sudoku auto solver

It creates file *pole.txt* where you put your problem and then you can get your answer.

Also i put here source code (if you wish, you can check it)
